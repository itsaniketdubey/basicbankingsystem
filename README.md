GRIP Task 1 for TheSparksFoundation
This is my internship project for TheSparksFoundation. Our aim was to create a basic banking app to show transactions between users and also record transaction histories.
I would like to thank TSF for this wonderful opportunity as it was a great learning experience for me.
